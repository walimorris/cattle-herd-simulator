# Cattle-Herding-simulator
A simple simulator that generates latitude/longitude data for each cattle in a herd (cattle location coming from devices that produce latitude/longitude coordinates). Simulates herding cattle north and updates location coordinates every one minute in a Amazon DynamoDB table.

There are many interesting features ranchers can benefit from by using AWS during a cattle-herd movement. The first step to examining these benefits is to first simulate the movement of cattle. With a simulation you can reset, test strange cattle movements, and different useful features ranchers can actually use. 

More coming soon!
